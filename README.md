### Plugin Setup
None required.

#### Plugin Configuration Fields
Litespeed writes server statistics to multiple report files in the /tmp/lshttpd folder by default, check your configuration to ensure that the path is correct.  The number of reports are based on the number of CPUs on your server and the number of CPUs that you have licences for.
